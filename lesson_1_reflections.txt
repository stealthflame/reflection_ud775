How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It helped me a lot as it made me find differences between two files easily and quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
It would help me to look back on these files later on if I ever ran across a problem and it would help me to experiment with the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

It wouldn't allow changes to happen mid line and I would be able to manually tag each change in the commit. The con is user error and forgetting to commit or not publishing commits at the right time.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I think that Google Docs isn't really meant for programming and coding.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I can use git log to acutally view the entire history of the file and then git diff will compare two different versions to see what exactly changed in each version.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It would allow me to make changes without worry and if something goes wrong I would be able to recover.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would like to use Git for when I start programming.
